# Hey, I’m Sahil 

I’m a software engineer who likes building things that feel good to use and make sense to people.

I care a lot about:
- Thoughtful product design
- Clean, maintainable systems
- Bridging engineering, design, and business
- Building tools that help humans do better work

I’ve worked across startups and larger companies, touching everything from frontend product features to backend services and platforms.

### What I’m usually thinking about
- How developers actually experience the tools they use
- Where AI can *reduce* cognitive load instead of adding to it
- Building systems that scale technically **and** socially
- Making software that’s powerful without being intimidating

### Tech I enjoy working with
- JavaScript / TypeScript, React
- Python, FastAPI
- APIs, microservices, and platform work
- Human-centered product engineering

### About my GitHub activity
A lot of my recent work lives in private repos or behind NDAs — turns out some companies don’t love it when you ship their production code to GitHub 😄  
That said, I’m always building, experimenting, and learning — even if not everything shows up here.

### Outside of code
- Runner + lifter (Boston Marathon is the dream)
- Photographer and studio art minor
- Big believer in empathy, curiosity, and growth

If you want to chat about products, engineering, or building things that actually matter, feel free to reach out.
