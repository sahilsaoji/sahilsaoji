# Hey, I’m Sahil

I’m a software engineer who likes building things that feel good to use and make sense to people.

I care a lot about:
- Thoughtful product design
- Clean, maintainable systems
- Bridging engineering, design, and business
- Building tools that help humans do better work

I’ve worked across startups and larger companies, touching everything from frontend product features to backend services and platforms.

### What I’m usually thinking about
- How developers actually experience the tools they use
- Where AI can *reduce* cognitive load instead of adding to it
- Building systems that scale technically and socially
- Making software that’s powerful without being intimidating

### Tech I enjoy working with
- JavaScript / TypeScript, React
- Python, FastAPI
- APIs, microservices, and platform work
- Human-centered product engineering

### About my GitHub activity
A lot of my recent work lives in private repos or behind NDAs, turns out some companies don’t love it when you ship their production code to GitHub   
That said, I’m always building, experimenting, and learning, even if not everything shows up here.

### Outside of code
- Running, lifting, skiing, playing soccer
- Finance, and Studio art minor

If you want to chat about products, engineering, or building things that actually matter, feel free to reach out.
